## Verifier Setup
Use the KILT Distillery CLI to setup: 
- .env
- didConfiguration.json

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

It's assumed you have a Sporran wallet installed with Credentials available. 

## TODO
- [ ] improve documentation
- [ ] move the setup flow to CLI
- [ ] CLI feature to create a test user with Credential on Peregrin
- [ ] refactor / organize / comment code
- [ ] add recipe to CLI
